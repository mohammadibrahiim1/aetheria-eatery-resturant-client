    "description": "Originating from Central Thailand, green curry is the spiciest of the Thai ‘holy trilogy’ and arguably, most familiar world-wide. This hugely popular dish is centered on fragrant green chilis– introduced to Thailand by Portuguese missionaries in the 16th century – giving the dish its distinctive green hue and fiery taste. Although simmered with coconut milk (toning things down somewhat, creating a rich, sweet nuance) and incorporating ingredients similar to many Thai curries (galangal, shallots, lemongrass, kaffir lime, Thai basil, etc), it’s those green chilies that make this dish seriously spicy. Green curry is also distinctive for its inclusion of mini eggplants, potatoes, bamboo shoots and slivers of chicken breast."

    "description": "One of Thailand’s most common curry varieties, red curries are a happy medium: generally spicier than yellow curries but less so than the green varieties. The distinctive red color of this rich, sweet and aromatic curry comes from crushed red chilies in the curry paste (a base of garlic, shallots, blue ginger and lemongrass), which is added to coconut milk, vegetables, such as eggplant, mushrooms, or tomatoes and chicken breast slices. The curry is topped off with finely sliced kaffir leaves and sweet basil, presenting a perfectly balanced combo of creamy and spicy broth to get those tastebuds tingling.One of the best-known red curry varieties, Massaman Chicken Curry, is mild, sweet and simmered in coconut milk; however, is unusual for its less soupy consistency and interpretation of a traditional Persian dish and Indian curry, made with roasted spices."
